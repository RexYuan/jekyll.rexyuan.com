Beyond the edgeless circle which shines placidly lies a venture to a dream. A dream allures me into voyaging the sea of possibility. Composed by the speculation of my innocent soul and stirred up by the excitement of my youthful heart, the fantasy was pulled into reality. With this blog as memory, my journey begins.

Through the office complexes woven by bricks, I barged into a place of tranquility. I found myself adrift under the sunlight sprinkled through the leaves, ranging the courses of trees as my mind wandered away from me. Classrooms were radiant with the joy of peace while brewing unsettling within. Exuberant as it was, I was quickly distracted by the beautifully peculiar library.

Upon entry, the refreshing air dissipated the heat and replaced it with the scent of vintage books. I spiraled up the stairs and roamed about the semi-circle fortress of rugged books which antiquated the concrete building. Outside the library and across the street was the famous night market, where incandescent streams of city light rejuvenated the tired breed.

As I walked in the broad campus, I wondered how many had walked the paths before, and how many there will be in the future. This school has witnessed thousands come and go, and I can almost see their marks around. I wondered how will my mark be.
