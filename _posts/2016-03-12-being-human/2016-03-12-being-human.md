Limerence was what I sought and what I found, but it was all that I received. I was intrigued, captivated, and bewitched by the northern girl, of the oriental capital, who ceaselessly amazes me. It felt warm and pink.

She arrived in my life with surprise. I had never met a girl so vast, with all her endless threads of curiosity. She caught me off guard, silently. Silently she had sneaked into my dreams, all within a week.

I say to me, to her, to everyone, that college is for us to experiment, to try, and to learn and to grow. You will try, you will fail, and you will succeed. There is nothing special about the distinction between success and failure - you live and you learn.

Yet, it's the side effect of feeling care. You fall in the embrace of affection. You fall for people. Intimacy comes with vulnerability, and when two people stand with naked heart, together they draw. If, with rare valiance, we, proud, charge.

Nothing ever goes according to plans. Confessions are risks. One can't even hope. Still, we try. Still, we put ourselves out there and put our hearts forward. Sometimes they take it with a smile, and sometimes they break it without care. This time, she gave it back to me, intact. I appreciated it.

She treaded softly on my dreams. It still hurts, but untouched. I had wondered and wondered about the outcome but never would I have ever thought it would be like this. Life is chance. I took it and it didn't go through. You win some and you lose some. This isn't the first time I was injured, but this time, I matured even more. I wasn't content but clock still ticks. All these shall pass. It's time to move on.

And so this is how being human feels like.
