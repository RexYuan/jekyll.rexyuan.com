After getting a Razer Blade 16 recently with Windows 11, I noticed that even though the lid is closed, the fans are still running audibly.

I searched around and found that it is a behavior of [modern standby](https://mysupport.razer.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/6029/~/modern-standby-in-razer-blade-laptops), also called the [S0 sleep](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/power/system-power-states#sleep-state-modern-standby). I then found that some people reported that the fan problem [could be solved](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLaptops/comments/13d6bbg/psa_razer_blade_18_supports_s3_sleep_disable/) by setting the computer to S3 sleep.

I wasn’t sure if it was true because the Windows Learn page said systems that support modern standby don’t support S1-S3 sleep and caution against switching to S3 sleep. I run the following in Powershell:

```dos
>powercfg -a
The following sleep states are available on this system:
    Standby (S0 Low Power Idle) Network Connected
    Hibernate
    Fast Startup

The following sleep states are not available on this system:
    Standby (S1)
        The system firmware does not support this standby state.
        This standby state is disabled when S0 low power idle is supported.

    Standby (S2)
        The system firmware does not support this standby state.
        This standby state is disabled when S0 low power idle is supported.

    Standby (S3)
        This standby state is disabled when S0 low power idle is supported.

    Hybrid Sleep
        Standby (S3) is not available.
```

However, the fan problem is too annoying so I tried anyway. I ran:

```dos
reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power /v PlatformAoAcOverride /t REG_DWORD /d 0
```

And then it showed that:

```dos
>powercfg -a
The following sleep states are available on this system:
    Standby (S3)
    Hibernate
    Hybrid Sleep
    Fast Startup

The following sleep states are not available on this system:
    Standby (S1)
        The system firmware does not support this standby state.

    Standby (S2)
        The system firmware does not support this standby state.

    Standby (S0 Low Power Idle)
        The system firmware does not support this standby state.
```

So it looks like it’s possible after all.

It’s been a week since running that command, and I can report that the fan problem is indeed gone. The fans promptly stop after I close the lid. The only other difference is that now when I open the lid the system doesn’t automatically wake up. Instead, I have to press a key to wake the computer.
